Diabetes Prediction Project

📋Project Overview
A comprehensive data mining project focused on predicting diabetes risk using medical and laboratory data. This project implements machine learning classification models to identify patients as Non-Diabetic (N), Prediabetic (P), or Diabetic (Y) based on clinical parameters.

🎯 Project Objectives
Predictive Modeling: Develop accurate classification models for diabetes prediction

Risk Factor Analysis: Identify key clinical markers associated with diabetes

Data Insights: Explore patterns and relationships in medical data

Visual Analytics: Create comprehensive visualizations for data understanding
